# THE TIMELINE

When you play back a recorded log file, a timeline representing the entire duration of the file appears at the bottom of the VCM Live window.

## Slide Bar

The highlighted area on this timeline indicates the moment you are currently viewing. The time span covered by this area corresponds to the time frame shown on [Time Graph](Using Time Graph Subwindows.md) subwindows.

The thin white vertical line on the slider bar indicates the exact time index of the data displayed on the time graph subwindows, gauges, and measurement lists. This time index appears in numerical form to the right of the slider bar.

## Zooming In and Out

The Zoom In and Zoom Out buttons on the toolbar to zoom in on a shorter time frame or zoom out to display a longer time frame:

| Icon | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| ![](zoom_in_icon.png) | Zoom in (show a shorter period of time in more detail).|
| ![](zoom_out_icon.png) | Zoom out (show a longer period of time in less detail).|

If your pointing device has a mouse wheel, you can also roll the mouse wheel backwards and forwards to zoom in and out.

## Moving To a Different Time Index

To move to a different time index in the log file playback, do one of the following:

- Drag and drop the slider to move it right or left.

- Click on a point in the timeline you want to jump to.
