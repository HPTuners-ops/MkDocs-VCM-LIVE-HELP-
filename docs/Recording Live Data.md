# RECORDING LIVE DATA

To do a live recording of ECU data with the current configuration:

1. Using an Ethernet cable, connect your computer to the ECU.

2. Open VCM Live.

3. Turn the vehicle ignition to a position other than OFF. (The engine can be running or stopped. But, the vehicle must supply power to the ECU.)

4. Click the ![](connect_to_vehicle_icon.png) icon in the toolbar to open a data connection to the ECU.

5. When VCM Live has finished connecting, click ![](start_scanning_icon.png) to start recording.
