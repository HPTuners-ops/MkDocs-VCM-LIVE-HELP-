# CONTACTING CUSTOMER SUPPORT

HP Tuners does not currently offer incoming phone support. The best way to reach our Support Department is to [create a ticket](https://hptuners.freshdesk.com/support/tickets/new?ticket_form=need_technical_support), or through our support live chat [help bot](https://support.hptuners.com/support/home), which is located on the right-hand corner of HP Tuners Support Website.

When you contact us, we may ask for a debug.dat file and a log.txt file. If possible, please include both of these files in your initial request. Both of these files can be found in the following location on computers that have VCM Live installed:
