# TABLE EDITOR RIGHT-CLICK MENU

Right clicking on a table in the table editor displays the following options:

## Copy

Copy a selected cell or section of the table to the clipboard.

## Copy with Axis

This function copies a selected cell or section of a table and includes the axis data. When used in conjunction with the Paste Special function, Copy With Axis allows the data to be pasted into another table without selecting the destination cell. Because the data was copied with axis labels, the software will automatically place the pasted data accordingly.
>**NOTE:** This is similar to the function in VCM Scanner's Graph panel and RTT Editor.

## Paste

Pastes a cell or table section into a selected cell. When pasting a copied region, the selected cell will become the top left cell in the pasted region.

## Paste Special

This function pastes data copied using the Copy With Axis feature into the current table.

The contents of the clipboard must be of the same dimensions as the contents of your table.

| Function | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Add | Add the contents of the clipboard to the table.|
| Subtract |Subtract the contents of the clipboard from the table. |
| Multiply %| Multiply the contents of the table by the clipboard values as a percentage.|
| Multiply % - Half | Multiply the contents of the table by the clipboard values as a percentage divided in half. |
| Average | Average the values between the clipboard and the table. |
