# SUPPORTED MATH OPERATIONS AND FUNCTIONS

The following operations and functions can be used when defining the math expressions used in variable measurements:

## Math for Calculations

The binary operations and functions listed below perform simple math calculations on the variables included in the expression.

### Supported Binary Operations

| Symbol | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| + | Sum up two operands.|
| - | Subtract two operands. |
| * | Multiply two operands.|
| / | Divide two operands.|
| ^ | Raise to a power. |

### Supported Functions

| Symbol | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Sin (x) | Returns the sine of x where x is in radians.|
| Cos (x) | Returns the cosine of x where x is in radians. |
| Tan (x) | Returns the tangent of x where x is in radians.|
| Abs (x) | Returns the absolute value of x.|
| Round (x) | Returns the whole number nearest x. |

## Conditionals

The relational and logical operations listed below are used when the output of the expression is intended to be binary (TRUE or FALSE).

- 1- indicates a TRUE result

- 0 - indicates a FALSE result

### Supported Relational Operations

| Symbol | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| > | If x > y, result is 1. If not, result is 0.|
| < | If x < y, result is 1. If not, result is 0. |
| = | If x = y, result is 1. If not, result is 0.|

### Supported Logical Operations

| Symbol | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| AND | If x = 1 (TRUE) and y = 1 (TRUE), result is 1. If not, result is 0.|
| OR | If x = 1 (TRUE) or y = 1 (TRUE), result is 1. If not, result is 0. |
| & | If x = 1 (TRUE) and y = 1 (TRUE), result is 1. If not, result is 0.|
| \| | If x = 1 (TRUE) and y = 1 (TRUE), result is 1. If not, result is 0.|
