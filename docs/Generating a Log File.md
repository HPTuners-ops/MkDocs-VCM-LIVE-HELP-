# GENERATING A LOG FILE

Recorded data can be saved to a log file, which can be opened later for further review and analysis. There are two ways to generate such a file:

- Save a live recording. See [Recording Live Data](Recording Live Data.md)

- Configure the ECU to automatically record data when certain trigger conditions are met and then retrieve the saved files from the ECU's memory. See [Standalone Logging Configuration](Standalone Logging Configuration.md)
