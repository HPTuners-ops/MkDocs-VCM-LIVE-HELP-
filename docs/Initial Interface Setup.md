# INITIAL INTERFACE SETUP

Follow these steps to configure the VCM Live interface for first time use:

1. Set up your desired scanning and tuning interfaces. You can load one of the default interface setups by doing the following:

    a. 	In the menu bar, select Layout > Default Layouts

    b. Select one of the listed layouts. A window which prompts you to select the tabs to load appears

    c. By default, all tabs in the selected layout will be loaded. If you wish to remove a tab, select it in the right column, and then click the **<<** icon

    d. When you are finished selecting tabs, click OK

    > **NOTE:**
    >For more information on customizing the layout, refer to [Layouts](Layouts.md).

2. If desired, enable live tuning by selecting Live Tuning Enabled from the Tune menu. When live tuning is enabled, the majority of changes to tunable parameters will take effect immediately. However, some will require flashing the tune to the ECU.

    >**NOTE:**
    > For more information on which parameters require flashing, see the [Parameter Guide](https://files.hptuners.com/help/CoreParameterGuide.pdf). The descriptions for these parameters indicate that flashing is required.

    - If live tuning is NOT enabled, all changes require flashing
    - When a flash is required, click ![](write_vehicle_icon.png) icon

3. Additional user preferences can be found in the Options window. See [Options](Options.md).
