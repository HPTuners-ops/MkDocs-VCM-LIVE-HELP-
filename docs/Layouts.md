# LAYOUTS

Layouts specify the arrangement and content of the subwindows that appear in the main display area of VCM Live. There are two basic elements of a layout:

- **Layout Pages (Tabs)** - an individual layout can contain multiple pages, which are selected using the tabs just below the toolbar. See [Layout Pages (Tabs)](Layout Pages (Tabs).md) for more information on adding, removing and configuring pages.

- **Subwindows** - subwindows representing sensor data or groups of tunable parameters can be added to the layout and then moved, resized, and configured in multiple ways. See [Subwindows](Subwindows.md) for more information.
>**NOTE:** Modifying a layout involves changing these elements. Refer to the relevant sections.
