# GETTING STARTED

The following steps are required for new users of VCM Live.

1. Install the software (see below).
2. Connect to the ECU and write an initial tune to it (required for new ECUs).See [Connecting to a New ECU](Connecting to a New ECU.md).
3. Load a default layout for the VCM Live user interface. Set other user preferences and customize as desired. See [Initial Interface Setup](Initial Interface Setup.md).
4. Run the Setup Wizard to quickly configure many of the ECUs basic settings to reflect the actual hardware (specific sensor types, etc.) used by the vehicle. See [Running the Setup Wizard](Running the Setup Wizard.md).
