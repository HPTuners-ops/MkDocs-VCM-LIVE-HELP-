# ADDING A TIME GRAPH

A time graph displays line charts of one or more signals over time. When scanning an ECU, the charts are drawn in real time. During playback of a log file, they display a time window surrounding the current time index of the playback.

The below window will appear, create your desired group (s) with which ever measurements you desire, utilize the below **Adding a Group** & **Adding a Signal (Measurement) to a Group** instructions to do so.
